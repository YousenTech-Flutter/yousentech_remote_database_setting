# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the
# following page: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/image/
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Tajawal
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/Tajawal-Medium.ttf
  #   - family: Tajawal
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/Tajawal-Bold.ttf
  #   - family: ARIALBD
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/ARIALBD.TTF
  #   - family: ARIALBD
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/ARIAL.TTF
  #
  # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
